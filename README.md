☕ Code Rush Daily – Java DSA Practice 🚀

Welcome to Code Rush Daily – Java Edition!
This repository is my personal commitment to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems daily using Java, starting from beginner level and gradually moving to medium level.

I started this repository 4 days ago, focusing on strong fundamentals, clean code, and interview-oriented problem solving.

🧠 Goal

Build strong DSA fundamentals in Java

Maintain daily coding consistency

Prepare for coding interviews (Product & Service-based companies)

Improve logic, time & space complexity analysis

💻 Language Used

☕ Java (100%)

🔧 DSA Techniques & Patterns Covered

Problems are solved using standard and popular DSA patterns, including:

Arrays & Strings

Two Pointers

Sliding Window

Stack & Queue

Hashing (HashMap / HashSet)

Sorting & Searching

Recursion & Basics of Backtracking

Binary Search

Greedy (coming soon)

Dynamic Programming (coming soon)

🌍 Platforms Practiced From

Problems are selected from multiple coding platforms:

LeetCode

CodeChef

HackerRank

GeeksforGeeks

TCS NQT / Prime problems

Other interview-based sources
